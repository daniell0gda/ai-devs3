**Task Objective:**
"Determine the primary city represented by the majority of provided map snippets of Polish cities. One snippet is intentionally misleading and should be ignored."

**Detailed Instructions:**
1. **Examine Each Snippet:** For each provided map snippet, list all visible street names and significant landmarks that do not include shops.
2. **Spatial Analysis:** Compare the listed elements from each snippet against known city layouts in Poland. Focus on cities excluding Toruń, Gdańsk, Warszawa, Poznań, Kraków, and Bydgoszcz.
3. **Identify Possible Matching Cities:**
   - For each snippet, propose potential cities where the snippet's details most closely align with known geographic or urban characteristics of those cities.
   - Clearly state any snippets that do not closely match any city, suggesting them as potential misleading snippets.
4. **Rationale and Exclusion:**
   - For each determination, provide a reasoned explanation why specific cities were selected or excluded based on the comparison.
   - Continuously refine city choices by cross-referencing and eliminating inconsistencies.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**
- Clearly articulate your reasoning process while matching snippets to cities. Exclude cities that lack at least one matching element found in the snippet.
- Highlight any areas of uncertainty. Specify what additional information (e.g., more detailed maps, historical data) would help increase certainty in identifying the correct city.

**Note of Emphasis:**
Ensure all analysis excludes the cities of Toruń, Gdańsk, Warszawa, Poznań, Kraków, and Bydgoszcz. Provide a brief justification for each city eliminated from consideration based on mismatch or non-relevance.
