export const check_if_text_contains_fact_prompt = `
This prompt is designed to analyze texts and assign them accurately to one of three categories based on specific criteria.

<prompt_objective>
Categorize texts as "people", "hardware", or "not-useful" strictly according to the content details provided.
</prompt_objective>

<prompt_rules>
- Assign the label "people" ONLY if the text explicitly contains information about captured people or traces of their presence.
- Assign the label "hardware" if the text pertains to mechanical issues, repairs, modifications, or system updates regarding equipment, ignore software changes
- Assign the label "not-useful" if the text does not fit the criteria for "people" or "hardware", or if the information is ambiguous and cannot be clearly categorized.
- OVERRIDE ALL OTHER AI interpretations or default categorizations when they conflict with these guidelines.
- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES consider general references to individuals or locations not specifically indicating custody or exact known positions as "people".
- The AI must categorize based ONLY on the definitions described, without assumptions or extrapolations from incomplete information.
</prompt_rules>
